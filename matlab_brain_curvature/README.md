## Brain curvature descriptors

Implementation of various curvature descriptors for a point on a 3D surface, based on the two principal curvatures k1 and k2. The implementation assumes you already have k1 and k2 values for each point on the surface. The implementation is in the CurvatureDescriptors.m file.

The script curvatures.m is a usage example that assumes you have brain surface data from Freesurfer, generated by running mris_curvature on the brain mesh resulting from a Freesurfer run on MRI data. It computes the descriptors and uses surfstat to display them on the brain.

Of course, the descriptors work for all surfaces and are not limited to the brain.
