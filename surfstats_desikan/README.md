= Demo: Visualization of FreeSurfer surface annotations in Matlab using SurfStat =

This directory contains a Matlab script that illustrates howto load a FreeSurfer annotation file in SurfStat and display the results on the surface of a subject.

The example uses the Desikan parcellation of the subjects surface (which is generated by FreeSurfer by default.)

Here is a screenshot of the results:
