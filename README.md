# comp_neuro_science
My playground for trying some computational neuroscience tools. Just ignore this, you don't want it.

It's mainly Matlab and Python. If you think you care, there are more README files in the sub directories. The environment.yml files that can be found in some directories are for conda, see https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html for info on how to use them.
