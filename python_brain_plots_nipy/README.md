The python script `plot_demo_glass_brain_extensive.py` has been downloaded by Tim from the nipy website.

To install nipy under Ubuntu 18.04 and be able to run it, do the following:

    sudo apt-get install python python-pip
    pip install nilearn sklearn

This should do it for the installation of nipy. Now run the script to ensure the installation works:

    chmod +x plot_demo_glass_brain_extensive.py
    python ./plot_demo_glass_brain_extensive.py

Hope this helps.
