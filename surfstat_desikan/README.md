# Demo: Visualization of FreeSurfer surface annotations in Matlab using SurfStat

This directory contains a Matlab script, `desikan_visualization_surfstat.m`, that illustrates howto load a FreeSurfer annotation file in SurfStat and display the results on the surface of a subject.

The example uses the Desikan parcellation of the subjects surface (which is generated by FreeSurfer by default.)

Here is a screenshot of the results:

## Requirements

To run this, you need the Matlab and the following 2 (free) toolboxes:

- the FreeSurfer matlab functions (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/, they come with FreeSurfer and can be found in $FREESURFER_HOME/matlab/ after installation)
- SurfStat by Keith Worsley (http://www.math.mcgill.ca/keith/surfstat/)

Note that you also need the helper function from this dir, `plot_data_onto_subject.m`, on your matlab path.
